						<ul>

							<li><b>Talent at young age</b> - Segovia was born in Linares, Jaén, Spain. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle Eduardo and his wife María. Eduardo arranged for Segovia's first music lessons with a violin teacher after recognizing that Segovia had an aptitude for music.</li>

							<li><b>First Attempt at Performance</b> - Segovia's first public performance was in Granada at the age of 16 in 1909.</li>
							
							<li><b>Impressive play gained acclaimed composers attention</b> - In 1923 Segovia was in Mexico for the first time. There Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in El Universal. Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia, including numerous sonatas.
							</li>
							
							<li><b><i>Nobility of Span</i></b> - In recognition of his contributions to music and the arts, Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981  by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marques de Salobrena (English: Marquis of Salobrena) in the nobility of Spain.</li>
							
							<li><b>Technique</b> - Segovia's technique differed from that of Tarrega and his followers, such as Emilio Pujol. Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of his fingernails and fingertips, producing a sharper sound than many of his contemporaries. With this technique, it was possible to create a wider range of timbres than when using the fingertips or nails alone.</li>
							<li><b>Teaching</b> - Segovia viewed teaching as vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at Música en Compostela in the northern Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela.</li>
							<li><b>Legacy</b> - Segovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. It was Federico Moreno Torroba who said: "The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andres Segovia".</li>
							<li><b>Awards</b> - Segovia was awarded many prizes and honours including Ph.D, honoris causa from ten universities. He received the Danish Sonning Award in 1974, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1985, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986.</li>
							
							<li><b>Grand-father of the Classical Guitar</b> - He is regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time and the grandfather of the classical guitar. Many professional classical guitarists today are students of Segovia, or students of his students</li>
